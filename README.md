# SwiftLingo
Localization is time-consuming so I made a package to automate the task.

## Steps to setup: 
- Import the pacakge `https://github.com/kumarneel/SwiftLingo`
- Setup a folder where you would like to store your localized information
- Create a `.swift` file called `LocalizableStrings` and a `.string` file called `Localizable`
- Import the SwiftLingo Package, call `initalize()`, pass in directory where these files are and the desired languages
